# Supervised Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Coursera) Code Repository
Welcome to the code repository for the Supervised Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera! This repository contains my implementations of the programming assignments and exercises taught in the course

This repository is organized by week, with each week corresponding to a specific topic covered in the course. Inside each week's folder, you'll find the code for the Lab and programming assignments and any additional exercises.
